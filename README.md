A training project for a complicated implementation of a login using a JWT token.
To start the project, you need to start the server in a separate execution environment and run the client in a separate environment.
The server is developed and tested using the MongoDB database.
The client is developed with a standard template:
	$ npx create-react-app client --template typescript

```
To start server

	./server$	npm run dev
	
The server will be started at 'http://localhost:9009'

```
To start client

	./client$	npm start
	
The client will be automatically launched in the default browser at 'http://localhost:3000'
